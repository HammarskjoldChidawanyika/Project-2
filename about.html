        <h1>Our Story</h1>
    </div>

<div>
    <p class= "began">
    Our story began in 1999 when we </br> 
    worked together as graphic </br> 
    designers in a publishing company. </br> 
    We used to call each other by our </br> 
    favourite cartoon characters Timon </br> 
    and Pumba being avid animation </br> 
    lovers.</br>
    
    Our period of working together was </br> 
    cut short as opportunities elsewhere </br> 
    backoned. We kept in touch for the </br> 
    love of our connection as Timon and </br> 
    Pumba. </br> 
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p class= "competences">
    Our competences got resounding </br> 
    expansion in academia and work </br> 
    experience.  Pumba is more savvy </br> 
    in webhosting, app development, </br> 
    SEO, website performance, digital </br> 
    strategy, video production and is a </br> 
    part-time lecturer in an internation- </br> 
    ally recognised university. Timon </br> 
    studied for BA Hons in Advertising  </br> 
    and Marketing Communications and </br> 
    went on to do MSc Food Chain Sys- </br> 
    tems where he specialised in food </br> 
    packaging. He has worked in </br>

    various positions as a packaging </br>

    hnician in the food manufacturing </br> 
    and distribution industries where </br> 
    he understood issues around pack- </br> 
    aging integrity and food safety. </br> 

    Regardless of the years apart, we </br> 
    decided to form a business toge- </br> 
    ther, harnessing the digital age, </br> 
    and the firm was born as global </br> 
    with an office in Bedford, UK and </br> 
    another one in Johannesburg, SA. </br>
